# Pricing

The price of an Opportunies job posting is determined by the length the post is live and the number of boards the post is hosted on.

Posts have a base price of $5 per month, which is then multiplied by the number of boards selected during post creation.

For example, a post created for 3 months and hosted on all 5 boards would have a total cost of $75.
